### About

The purpose of this Shiny app is to show the distribution of undervalued and overvalued homes in southern California based on their actual sale price vs their estimated sale price. 

The estimated sales price of each home was determined using a neural network model. The model is built using features of the house, such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, as well as features of the area the house is located in, such as the median education level, crime rate, etc.
